# Web App Salon

## Introduction
This is a practice project designed to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS with SASS, and JavaScript, utilizing Gulp to compile SASS and optimize image formats. The project is built in an npm environment with dev dependencies and manages additional libraries using Composer. Additionally, it incorporates PHP and SQL to handle user information.

The goal of this project is to develop a real-world appointment scheduling website for a beauty salon. On this website, users will have the option to sign up with email confirmation and log in to their accounts. If they forget their password, they can reset it easily.

Once logged in, users will be able to view all available salon services along with their prices and select the ones they want to book. They can then proceed to the appointment details section, where they can enter their name, date, and preferred time. After that, they will see a summary of their selections before confirming the appointment.

The project also includes an admin panel, where administrators can view all scheduled appointments along with client information based on the selected date.

To ensure a well-structured and scalable codebase, the project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. Additionally, it implements Active Record to simplify database interactions, providing a more intuitive and structured way to handle CRUD operations.
